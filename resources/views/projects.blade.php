        <p class="lead"><i>This project was done as an end of year project for 
            my high school physics class. Taxvova.com is a kinematics equation
            calculator, which just means that it solves physics problems
            relating to motion of a constant acceleration.</i></p>
        <p>This was mine and my partner's first experience programming, as well
            as our first experience using version control. It was a scary
            experience, but it is also what inspired me to choose computer
            science as my career path.</p>
